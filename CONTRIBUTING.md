### Licensing implications

By submitting a PR to this project you agree to release the source code under the Polyform v1.0.0
Small Business License, or any future version of an equivalent Polyform License published by
Polyform Labs. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

**Note:** It will be pointed out that this is not an open source license as defined by the Open
Source Initiative. While discussions of the intricacies of the open source ecosystem is out of the
scope of this document, this is a brief reasoning for the choice of license:

- We are passionate about open source. We believe that open source is the best way to develop
  software. But, in recent times, there has been an increasing trend of big corporations using open
  source software to amass incredible profits without giving the least bit of financial support to
  the developers who passionately maintain these projects. This is not sustainable.

- As a result, we are seeing increased security risks of open source projects being abandoned due to
  lack of funding. We believe that we can find a better way forward.

- What are the implications for you as a contributor?

  - We define the licensor with respect to the Polyform license as the active contributors to the
    project (see exact definition in the [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) file). As things currently
    stand, they are contributors who have engaged with the project in the last 6 monts, proportional
    to the amount of code they have contributed.

  - Decisions are driven democratically, by a weighed vote proportional to their contribution.

  - You are allowed to explicitly waive your licensor rights and your active contributor status, if
    you so wish, at any time. This will not affect your rights to use the software, but it will
    affect your rights and responsibilities in the governance of the project.

  - Your rights as an active contributor have no implications on your rights to use the software.
    You are free to use the software under the terms of the license, regardless of your status as an
    active contributor. To clarify, even if you as an individual person are an active contributor,
    this does not extend to your employer or any other entity you may be affiliated with.
