### Licensing implications

By submitting a PR to this project you agree to release the source code under
the Polyform v1.0.0 Small Business License, or any future version of the
Polyform License published by Polyform Labs. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

**Note:** It will be pointed out that this is not an open source license
as defined by the Open Source Initiative. While discussions of the intricacies
of the open source ecosystem is out of the scope of this document, this is a
brief reasoning for the choice of license:

  * We are passionate about open source. We believe that open source is the best
    way to develop software. But, in recent times, there has been an increasing
    trend of big corporations using open source software to amass incredible
    profits without giving the least bit of financial support to the developers
    who passionately maintain these projects. This is not sustainable.

  * As a result, we are seeing increased security risks of open source projects
    being abandoned due to lack of funding. We believe that we can find a better
    way forward.

  * What are the implications for you?

      * If you're not developing functionality that relies exclusively or
        substantially on plumb, you can use it as if it were an MPL 2.0 licensed
        project. The only extra requirement is you needing to include the
        Commons Clause alongside the MPL 2.0 license.

      * The licensors under the Commons Clause are defined as the active
        contributors to the project, weighed by the amount of code contributed
        in the last 6 months. You can find out more information in the
        [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) file. But, in short, as long as you
        participate in this project, by default, you are a licensor.

      * Decisions are driven democratically, by a weighed vote proportional to
        the amount of code contributed, by a simple majority vote with a quorum
        defined as 50% of the active contributors:

          * Active contributors are individuals (not code or bots) that
            have contributed code to the project  Engaged means participating
            over the last 6 months in discussions, reviewing PRs, submitting
            PRs, publishing issues, etc., as well as contributing code.

      * You are allowed to explicitly waive your licensor rights and your active
        contributor status, if you so wish, at any time. This will not affect
        your rights to use the software, but it will affect your rights and
        responsibilities in the governance of the project.

  * What does substantially mean? Use your best judgement. A good rule of
    thumb is *Would your project be impossible to develop without plumb? Would
    you have to end up reimplementing a significant portion of plumb to achieve
    the same functionality?* If the answer is yes, then you're developing
    functionality that relies substantially on plumb.

      * Some examples:
          * Just selling plumb itself as a service, or as a product;
          * Naming it gold and doing the same;
          * Building a GUI on top of plumb without significant additional
            functionality;
          * Writing an IDE extension that relies on plumb for its core
            functionality.

      * Some counterexamples:
          * Using plumb as a dependency in a project that you are not selling
            as a service or product, regardless of whether it is open source or
            not, or whether it's based substantially on plumb or not;
          * Packaging plumb for free distribution within an OS distribution or
            package manager;
          * Just outright using the software, even in your company. You are
            perfectly fine to use plumb as a software.
